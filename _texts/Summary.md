We work according to a narrative. The conventional narrative defines legitimate work within a fixed progression from incomplete to complete. Conceptual labor is a distinct form of work that includes the efforts to continuously modify the narrative that defines legitimate work and how to do it. 

To do conceptual labor, one must be able to conceive of and manipulate a dynamic mental model of work. These models can be described by three fundamental components: Actors, Labor, and Context. Humans experience all types of work through their models, whether or not those models accurately represent real world conditions.

In a given job, if the Actor, Labor, and Context are all able to change themselves and each other, conceptual labor is required and conventional labor will fail. Overwhelming anecdotal, experiential, and scientific evidence shows that humans default to a conventional narrative of work, where at least one element can be treated as reliable and fixed (eg the Labor may change as you go on, and the Actor’s state of mind may adapt, but the end goals and their means of achieving them --- the Context --- will be treated as if they are defined and known.) By definition, conceptual labor is a continuous process that occurs as long as the Actor’s model changes.

In this process, Actors represent and compare models and their components to align them with the changing requirements of their work. The decision to keep changing or to stick with what you know is a self-reflective process that must criticize and justify its own rules and progress. This generates meta-processes that apply generally to labor, conceptual or not. These processes often emerge by inferring broader principles from direct experience with specific kinds of work. In this way, conceptual labor proceeds from direct experience to abstraction and returns to direct experience, without regard to conventional definitions of work.
