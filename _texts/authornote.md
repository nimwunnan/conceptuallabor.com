One of the unique challenges of writing the Theory was to find an appropriate approach to citing the near-infinite amount of relevant source material. I struggled to respect and acknowledge the vast scope of existing theory that prominent figures in many fields have written about the conceptual labor specific to their disciplines without situating the Theory in any one of them more than the other. Examples needed to be succinct without being glib, and certain terms must be avoided, like a particularly strong pigment, lest they color the whole text with the connotations of a particular industry, discipline, or type of book. Conversely, the subjects in which I do have a depth of experience were even more hazardous to the tone and pretenses to neutrality of this text, being both my native language of conceptual labor and the main arenas in which I can examine it. That the final tenet uses the example of a painter at their easel as a metaphor for major lessons of the Theory is my way of coming clean.

This theory and its resulting framework were distilled from methods and patterns which can be found in the practices and theory of countless other disciplines. It is not meant to define which activities are conceptual labor and which aren’t; that would be as useful and possible as documenting every change in the surface of a river. It is more to say that one can identify patterns of conditions, habits, and questions that tend to be useful in understanding and navigating almost any river. 

To go one step further, it suggests that though these patterns of work are not secret, but they are usually hidden in the fabric of the conventional stories we tell about work. By naming and studying these patterns, we should be able to spot them more readily, rather than falling back on comfortable narratives of how work should go.

Some patterns are simple to translate between disciplines. “Put your tools away when you are done” can be easily applied by someone who doesn’t work with physical tools. But ask any expert who loves their field, and they will tell you how their profession has taught them something about the rest of life that they would not have known otherwise. Some might even be ready with a pitch for why everyone should study what they study. We can’t assume that they’ve all discovered the same things, or in the same proportions. It is a compelling thought to imagine that their enthusiasm is justified, and that countless secret methods, useful to anyone who does hard work, lie hidden behind the labels we use to organize professions and subjects.

It is my hope that with this theory, the lessons we learn from the hard work we do in one discipline can be more readily translated and applied to another. The more familiar we are with common patterns of conceptual labor, the more quickly we can recognize them when they show up in new circumstances, dressed up in the appearance of a novel task. I believe that we have yet to appreciate the extent to which valuable practices and knowledge can be transferred from the ontologies of one field to another.

A shared language of conceptual labor can enhance the ease and effectiveness with which such patterns can be understood and shared, in the work that we recognize as work as well as the important areas of our personal lives as citizens that we each labor daily to improve.

So that is all to say that, with the Theory in our back pocket, there is much, much more to discover. When we use it to expand our definitions of work, the Theory can bridge the gap between different disciplines --- or different areas of the same discipline --- that do similar conceptual labor in their own ways, so we ought to try to build bridges. When we turn to it to articulate and navigate our individual experience of work, it can provide new ways to catalogue the countless effective patterns of working that have been discovered and refined by artists and writers, researchers and engineers, counselors and parents, and so on. So we ought to try to build a card catalogue for this vast library. If we use it to see through established narratives, we can expose important work which is overlooked, willfully or by accident, so we ought to write new job descriptions and build new unions. Perhaps most importantly it can help us figure out if we are thinking what we think we are thinking and if we are doing what we think we are doing. In this era of unintended consequences we ought to double-check on whatever scale we can.

I had the great privelege of spending my days in practice and study for a few years. I practiced painting at a school built to teach it, martial arts in a welcoming local community, and writing and 

studying painting at the Glasgow School of Art, where I was surrounded by professors, working artists, and fellow students who were seriously, generously, and earnestly trying to make art and know what it means to do so. At the same time, I was trying to learn martial arts for the first time, 

Straightforward study and rote practice could only get you so far. The comforting certainty that came with 




At first I thought that this was a feature of the subjects I studied, that it was mainly art-ness that escaped explanation. After many episodes of feeling like I had finally figured something out only to find myself in a dead end, I began 

* when you study art, you encounter lots of executive maps
* even working on my own, I felt a tendency to drift towards "an inadequate yet comforting certainty"
* this was always a trap


 until I graduated and started working as a web developer. While learning even the basics of programming, I recognized the same patterns of working, learning, and talking that I thought belonged in “the arts.” 


### Precursors

* At school, I wrote my dissertation on the conflict between fundamental uncertainty of the work of making art and the obligations of an institution founded on the idea that it can reliably graduate students who have learned how to do that work. 

* That was mainly focused on A-art institutions, but made furtive attempts to connect to the world of computer programming.

After I graduated, I was left with the hunch that the patterns I was seeing were more fundamental to working and learning than I could understand from my own experience. This led me to found a small organization dedicated to talking about work and ideas across disciplines. For five years, I listened to how people described, in their own terms, what was important to them about their work and how they did it. In the conversations at these events, people naturally identified common patterns and practices of working. It became clear that the only special claim art had over these patterns was that when, for lack of a better term, someone said there was “an art” to what they did, they began to talk about the patterns I was looking for.
 
My first attempt at a theory was to try to extract these patterns from my personal experience of trying to do this work as a painter, which became the essay [The Thing I am Trying to Do](http://painting.school){:target="blank"}. While developing that essay, I taught two classes at a code school which incorporated early ideas of the Theory, focused on its expression in the tech industry. Finishing that essay and seeing my students successfully apply the ideas to their jobs and careers spurred me to develop a general theory.
