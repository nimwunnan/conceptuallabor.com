## The Project
---
Often, when people attempt to describe the most difficult work they do, they will say that there’s “an art” to it. In many ways, this theory is a way of answering the questions of _what do people mean whey they say that, what are the common qualities of the work they’re talking about,_ and _how do they fit together?_ 

This site is meant to be the first step of publication of a theory of work that is hoped to be useful to anyone who does this kind of difficult work, whether it is with their brain, their body, or with the wills of other people. It is meant to serve as a central reference point of discussions surrounding Conceptual Labor and provide public access to the main theory. Future relevant resources and projects will be announced or archived here.

## Where Conceptual Labor Comes from

---


This project began a decade ago by noticing patterns in the way that different disciplines talk about how to do the hardest work they require. The fields I was most closely studying were contemporary painting, internal martial arts, and writing. Much of the advice I got from experts in each field sounded strangely similar. They emphasized that the work could not be directly explained, instead it had to be cultivated and chased down, which required its own special kind of work and learning. This led me to write my dissertation on the language used by schools that try to guarantee that they can teach this kind of work. It seemed that the point of these disciplines wasn’t completely explicable, and hid behind the parts that were easiest to teach and describe. I thought this was a special condition of the arts until I graduated and began work as a web developer. While learning even the basics of programming, I recognized patterns of working, learning, and talking that I thought belonged in “the arts.” I founded an organization dedicated to talking about work and ideas across disciplines, and listened to how people described how they did what they did for five years. The only special claim art had was that when, for lack of a better term, someone said there was “an art” to what they did, they began to talk about the patterns I was looking for. 

I wrote a precursor to this theory that focused on its place in fields that were described as arts which can be found on its own site, painting.school. During that time I taught two classes at a local code school that incorporated part of my theory. Finishing that essay and seeing my students successfully apply the ideas to their jobs and careers spurred me to develop a general theory, which is presented here.

## Acknowledgements

--- 

I am absurdly fortunate to have as many talented, insightful, patient, and whip-smart friends in my life as I do, and I owe each of them some degree of thanks. However, I could not have written this without the ongoing, meticulous and critical attention that [Amber Case](http://caseorganic.com/) and [Delphine Bedient](http://quotidianpress.com/) have paid to my ideas and my writing, for which I am more grateful than I can say. [Vivian Hua](http://vivianhua.com/) and [Dustin Zemel](https://www.dustinzemel.com/) also provided incisive and thoughtful feedback on early drafts. The regular quorums I have enjoyed with [John James Dudek](http://funwithjohnjames.com/), [Evan Dumas](http://www.eedumas.com/), and [Nik Wise](http://nikolas.ws/) provided consistent space for these ideas to breathe, which is just as vital but more easily overlooked than direct editing. I must also single out my patient, early readers including [Alex Dolan-Mescal](http://dhalab.org/alexdm/), Claire Heacox, Alex Black, [Gabriel Shalom](http://www.gabrielshalom.com/), Van Pham, [Ezra Spier](https://ahhrrr.com/) and my family. [Robby Kraft](https://robbykraft.com/) and Vernon Wauklyn each issued me challenges in unexpected places that led to large amounts of research and writing, and Mathew Lippincott has a talent for discussing the practical application of abstract ideas while in motion, usually on bicycles. My instructor, Jaime Tan, has been a guide and inspiration in his generosity, patience, humor, raw skill, and integrity as a teacher and martial artist.
