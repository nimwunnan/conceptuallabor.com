  <p>Nerd warning – this gets pretty wonky in the details of text editors, open standards, etc. If you dont find that kind of thing interesting, you might not find this interesting either.</p>

<h3 id="the-long-personal-story-that-comes-before-the-recipe">The long personal story that comes before the recipe</h3>

<p>(skip this is if you just want to see the tools)</p>

<p>I say that it took ten years to write Conceptual Labor, which is wrong in both directions. I was working or thinking seriously about the ideas in it well before that, but I also only knew I was writing a book about this for about five or six years. Wherever you draw the line, I worked on this long enough that the tools I used to write it had plenty of time to evolve and adapt as I refined my model of the hyperobject of work that was “Write the Book”.</p>

<p>How my tools and methods got to where they ended up reminds of me an experience I had that became a personal archetype about the efficiency of messy work and simple rules. I was 20, living in Portland Oregon, and completely jacked on coffee at sidewalk table outside a cafe in Southeast, looking West. I looked up from my book and was struck by the expanse of forest in the West Hills, across the river. Portland is home to Forest Park – one of the larger parks within city limits in America. I’d been <em>there</em> – what hit me in that moment was that there was a stretch of forest nearly the same size of forest park on the <em>other</em> side of downtown. (Forest Park roughly begins at the division between north and south in Portland – Burnside street – and continues north. What I was looking at was all on the south side – a combination of Washington Park and the lesser-known Marquam Nature Area. This happened many years before the advent of Google Maps or smartphones.)</p>

<p>Being young, relatively without obligations, and posessed of a mountain bike in good condition, I decided to get into that forest. Once I got across the river to the foot of the hills, I set two rules for myself – I could only bike uphill and only south-west.  This sent me through some yards and other private property I could and should have avoided. It was a small but wonderful adventure, and by the time the caffiene and my enthusiasm wore off, I ended up at a park I had never heard of that had a fantastic view of the city, looking out in the direction of the the cafe where I had started.</p>

<p>Later, I learned that I had found Council Crest park, the highest point in Portland. My two rules turned out to be very effective, as long as I stuck to them.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with writing Conceptual Labor? Well, the last time I felt that archetype activated in my brain, like a power-up in a video game, was when I found this excellent article about <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown" target="blank">Sustainable Authorship</a>. It described, with a much more considered and intentional line of reasoning, almost the entire suite of tools I had come to rely on for writing and publishing the Theory, covering the rest of my tools in <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/collaborative-blog-with-jekyll-github">another article</a>.{:target=”blank”}</p>

<h3 id="the-tools-i-use-to-write">The tools I use to write</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All my text lives in markdown files.</li>
  <li>I use Obsidain, Folding Text, Ghost, or Sublime Text to write, depending on the device I’m on or the thing I’m writing.</li>
  <li>
    <p>For the print and e-book, I used pandoc to export an .icml document that preserved format and structure that InDesign could read.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>This was truly magical.</strong> The relatively-semantic structure that pandoc inferred from my markdown translated into a set of text and paragraph styles that InDesign recognized. This allowed me to set typography in detail for the whole 40,000 word text, in a structured, automated way instead of manually setting headlines, italics, and so on, line by line.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>For review editions, I used pandoc to export directly to .pdf</li>
  <li>This site runs on Jekyll, using the Ed. theme.
    <ul>
      <li>To publish blog posts like these, I can copy the markdown directly to a file in the site directory or use the admin plugin I run for convenience.</li>
      <li>
        <p>To publish the book on the site, I maintain a canonical version of the text which I broke up into individual markdown files for the convenience of readers.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I wrote a <a href="https://gist.github.com/nimdaghlian/d0621557883cd7c463eec59aea3d8e6c">simple php script</a> to re-number footnotes in the order they appear, for al the missing citations I caught while editing, and to make things easier on online-readers.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The bibliography is a work-in-progress, as I only started using Zotero when I began editing, and have some grooming to do before I can take advantage of the <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown#working-with-bibliographies" target="blank">portability of citations and auto-generation of bibliographies that Zotero can offer as part of this toolset.</a></li>
