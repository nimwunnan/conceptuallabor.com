        <div class="page">
  <h2 id="how-we-talk-about-work-is-how-we-work">How We Talk About Work Is How We Work</h2>

<p>All work follows a story. We work, consciously or not, according to a narrative that describes what we do, why we do it, and what it accomplishes. There are two different types of work in a basic narrative —  work that we think needs to be done, and the effort to figure out what to do.</p>

<p>Most narratives focus on the first type, work which applies directly to a problem. Given a task that takes longer to understand than to accomplish, we will often lament how much time we wasted getting to the “real work.” However real or fraudulent work may feel, we define it by what we can understand of it.</p>

<p>However, when we look back on a task that took surprising turns on the way to completion, a third, important type of work emerges from the whole process of picturing, doing, and understanding work. We will call this kind of work <em>conceptual labor</em>.</p>

<p>For a pithy example of how we encounter conceptual labor, we can turn to one of physicist Richard Feynman’s widely-read anecdotes. As an inquisitive child in the Great Depression, Feynman says he developed his early fascination with electronics into a side-hustle fixing radios. One day he was confronted with a radio that made a terrible noise he hadn’t heard before. He had to really think about what could be wrong, so he paced back and forth while modeling the radio in his head. Suddenly the owner of the radio shouted at him, complaining that he was just walking around, doing nothing, to which he shot back “I’m thinking!” Once Feynman fixed the radio, the previously impatient owner became his biggest fan. He found Feynman many more jobs while bragging up his ability — “He fixes radios by thinking!”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="looking-at-the-whole-problem-is-a-different-type-of-work">Looking at the Whole Problem is a Different Type of Work</h2>

<p>The memoir, <em>Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman</em>, opens with this anecdote and flows into examples of how the same kind of work applies to social situations, public education, and math. The story wasn’t just about radios, it was about a particular way of thinking and working, of dealing with “the whole problem of discovering what was the matter, and figuring out what you have to do to fix it.”
If we apply this kind of thinking to the anecdote itself, we can reveal something deeper about the nature of this type of work. What if we take his own advice when looking this narrative as it is presented to us as a guiding principle for Feynman’s life and work, and look at the “whole problem” of doing and talking about work? The narrative of the anecdote speaks about work, but the meta-narrative is about the speaker, Feynman.</p>

<p>Feynman was certainly one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century. So was his colleague and fellow Nobel-laureate Murray Gell-Mann, who notably observed that Feynman was interested in generating anecdotes about himself to shape his public persona as someone of limitless curiosity and a dominating intellect. A critical reading of his own stories and later biography reveal some limits of his drive to inquire. Feynman seemed distressingly content not to question of some of the most commonly under-thought conventions of his time, namely how to treat other people. As is so often the case, his expansive thinking contracted to boorish, sometimes violent treatment of women[footnote required]. Considering that history, none of his instructional anecdotes managed to break the same ground as one of the finest examples of “looking at the whole problem” of work — Arlie Hochschild’s <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520272941/the-managed-heart" target="blank"><em>The Managed Heart</em></a>.</p>

<p>Hochschild’s landmark study of the performative emotions required by the jobs of bank tellers and bill collectors gave us the term <em>emotional labor</em>. This named a massive, required component of many jobs that lay in plain view but was systemically overlooked because it did not fit into the conventional narrative of what constitutes valuable work. Feynman’s anecdote is useful and succinct — its punchline says that just because something doesn’t look like work doesn’t mean it’s not. But Hochschild is bold enough to see that the hidden nature of work extends to the social conditions of the workers themselves. If, as Feynman would have it, hard work requires us to take an active interpretation of the nature of work itself, we must question the worker’s conditions as well. We cannot stop simply because our personal comfort or standing may be threatened. A strategy that works in most contexts save for some biased oversights doesn’t truly look at the whole problem. Anecdotes, principles, or axioms about work that ignore the implied role and status of the speaker — or of entire categories of people — should be as suspect as ones that ignore relevant, practical information.</p>

<h2 id="expertise-requires-more-than-conventional-narratives-can-offer">Expertise Requires More Than Conventional Narratives Can Offer</h2>

<p>The unique value of the work done by experts comes from their ability to navigate, understand, and describe this kind of work<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, let alone execute it.</p>

<p>Everyone is an expert in something, even if it is only where to find things in their kitchen. At some point we have all struggled to explain, to ourselves or to others, why the job that non-experts think we are doing is completely different than the real, tricky thing we are trying to accomplish, even if it looks similar from the outside. We have no guarantee that the conceptual labor we have done to make our expert work possible will be visible to observers, and it is difficult to remember how a novice sees the task. Likewise, we have all been confronted by a complex task that, when prepared and executed by an expert, looks like child’s play.</p>

<p>We cannot understand expertise or innovation without conceptual labor. Painter James McNeil Whistler was highly influential on the development of modern painting, but his work was once ridiculed for its simplicity by critics who preferred classical technique. One such review led to a libel trial, where he famously defied the idea that the value of a painting was tied to the time spent painting it. When pressed if he asked market prices for “the labour of two days”, he responded: “No, I ask it for the knowledge I have gained in the work of a lifetime.”</p>

<p>A much more recent <a href="http://conceptuallabor.com/bibliography#ariley-locks" target="blank">anecdote from economist Dan Ariley</a> about a locksmith who lost wages as he gained mastery shows that the difficulty of putting a price on wisdom isn’t just a problem for professional artists. When the locksmith was still a novice, he would struggle with locks for hours at a time, sometimes breaking them. His customers waited and watched the whole process, and tipped him well for all of his hard work, even if they had to replace their lock. Once he became an expert, however, he could open locks in a fraction of the time, with apparent ease and without damaging them. Not only did this cause his customers to tip him less, but they started complaining about his base fee, even though they were getting a more valuable service. This locksmith had encountered his profession’s version of a refrain that painters have been hearing since at least Whistler’s time: “Well <em>I</em> could do <em>that.</em>”</p>

<h2 id="conceiving-of-work-is-work">Conceiving of Work Is Work</h2>

<p>The point here is that simply conceiving of work can be difficult. When we encounter work that lies beyond our imagination, we still judge it within the limits of our current understanding. Novices only see the work once it has been conceived, and without the domain knowledge, experience, and judgement of an expert, they fail to see how the work must be continuously re-conceived as it is performed.  They don’t appreciate the work it took to produce what’s in front of them at any given moment because, in part, they <em>can’t see it</em> without doing at least some of the work itself.<sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Conceptual labor creates the very ground on which it is performed.</p>

<p>This is why it’s not hard find experts who advocate for a new way to consider their work, regardless of discipline, that focuses on the conceptual labor involved.</p>

<p>A good starting point is any time someone uses the phrase “the art of,” such as Richard Hamming’s <a href="http://conceptuallabor.com/bibliography#hamming-art" target="blank"><em>The Art Of Doing Science and Engineering.</em></a> Lewis Thomas’s essay <a href="http://conceptuallabor.com/bibliography#thomas-lives" target="blank"><em>The Planning of Science</em></a> addresses conceptual labor in the biomedical field, Zadie Smith calls writing the “craft that defies craftsmanship” in her excellent essay <a href="http://conceptuallabor.com/bibliography#smith-fail" target="blank"><em>Fail Better</em></a>, Bret Victor’s talk <a href="http://conceptuallabor.com/bibliography#victor-media" target="blank"><em>Media for Thinking the Unthinkable</em></a> challenged coders and designers to deconstruct the media that encodes their ideas, Chris Argyris’s <a href="http://conceptuallabor.com/bibliography#argyris-teaching" target="blank"><em>Teaching Smart People How To Learn</em></a> brings it to the field of corporate management, and in math we have Paul Lockhart’s <a href="http://conceptuallabor.com/bibliography#lockhart-mathematician" target="blank"><em>A Mathematician’s Lament.</em></a> Rebecca Solnit’s profound and surprising tour around the territory of this way of thinking, <a href="http://conceptuallabor.com/bibliography#solnit-field" target="blank"><em>A Field Guide to Getting Lost,</em></a> digs into a challenge posed by Meno to Socrates: “How will you go about finding that thing the nature of which is totally unknown to you?”</p>

<p>This, surely, is hard work, but can we recognize it when we and others are doing it? To paraphrase Burton Rascoe, the spouses of writers will never understand that they are hard at work when staring out the window.</p>

<h2 id="the-endless-argument">The Endless Argument</h2>

<p>We have all been the writer, and we have all been the spouse, often both during the same project. As we produce and examine narratives of our own work, we are trying to see more than we can see.</p>

<p>Seeing the narrative of work for what it is rather than what we imagine it to be is the true difference between expert and novice. According to the novice, experts work beyond the boundary of confusing work, where all the work makes sense to those that know enough about it. The expert, however, knows that they will continually lose sight of the work as it evolves, and they have the skills and attitudes that let them move back and forth across that boundary of understanding.</p>

<p>We will never fully appreciate the work we are trying to invent before we have invented it. The disagreement between an objecting, impatient novice and an expert trying to explain the transformative nature of their work plays out in our own heads as we do difficult, conceptual labor.</p>

<p>Conventional narratives of work and the strategies that go with them assume that this will be an argument, and emphasize determination, persistence, and knowledge. These are fine qualities in the abstract, but also how you break a lock. A general theory of conceptual labor should provide rules of order to this argument so that it can become a lively conversation, full of productive debate and surprises.</p>

      <p>Feynman prided himself on being able to explain complex ideas simply, at one point declaring that, since he wasn’t able to describe an aspect of quantum mechanics to a freshman class, it was not fully understood by science. David L. Goodstein relates this anecdote in his introduction to a lecture by Feynman in <a href="http://conceptuallabor.com/bibliography#goodstein-feynman" target="blank">which he used only high-school geometry to describe planetary motion.</a> <a href="#fnref:fn1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p>Daniel Kahnamen’s research into how we frame our decisions based on available knowledge provides thorough support for this assertion.
