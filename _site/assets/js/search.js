  content: "How We Talk About Work Is How We Work\n\nAll work follows a story. We work, consciously or not, according to a narrative that describes what we do, why we do it, and what it accomplishes. There are two different types of work in a basic narrative —  work that we think needs to be done, and the effort to figure out what to do.\n\nMost narratives focus on the first type, work which applies directly to a problem. Given a task that takes longer to understand than to accomplish, we will often lament how much time we wasted getting to the “real work.” However real or fraudulent work may feel, we define it by what we can understand of it.\n\nHowever, when we look back on a task that took surprising turns on the way to completion, a third, important type of work emerges from the whole process of picturing, doing, and understanding work. We will call this kind of work conceptual labor.\n\nFor a pithy example of how we encounter conceptual labor, we can turn to one of physicist Richard Feynman’s widely-read anecdotes. As an inquisitive child in the Great Depression, Feynman says he developed his early fascination with electronics into a side-hustle fixing radios. One day he was confronted with a radio that made a terrible noise he hadn’t heard before. He had to really think about what could be wrong, so he paced back and forth while modeling the radio in his head. Suddenly the owner of the radio shouted at him, complaining that he was just walking around, doing nothing, to which he shot back “I’m thinking!” Once Feynman fixed the radio, the previously impatient owner became his biggest fan. He found Feynman many more jobs while bragging up his ability — “He fixes radios by thinking!”\n\n\n\nLooking at the Whole Problem is a Different Type of Work\n\nThe memoir, Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman, opens with this anecdote and flows into examples of how the same kind of work applies to social situations, public education, and math. The story wasn’t just about radios, it was about a particular way of thinking and working, of dealing with “the whole problem of discovering what was the matter, and figuring out what you have to do to fix it.”\nIf we apply this kind of thinking to the anecdote itself, we can reveal something deeper about the nature of this type of work. What if we take his own advice when looking this narrative as it is presented to us as a guiding principle for Feynman’s life and work, and look at the “whole problem” of doing and talking about work? The narrative of the anecdote speaks about work, but the meta-narrative is about the speaker, Feynman.\n\nFeynman was certainly one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century. So was his colleague and fellow Nobel-laureate Murray Gell-Mann, who notably observed that Feynman was interested in generating anecdotes about himself to shape his public persona as someone of limitless curiosity and a dominating intellect. A critical reading of his own stories and later biography reveal some limits of his drive to inquire. Feynman seemed distressingly content not to question of some of the most commonly under-thought conventions of his time, namely how to treat other people. As is so often the case, his expansive thinking contracted to boorish, sometimes violent treatment of women[footnote required]. Considering that history, none of his instructional anecdotes managed to break the same ground as one of the finest examples of “looking at the whole problem” of work — Arlie Hochschild’s The Managed Heart.\n\nHochschild’s landmark study of the performative emotions required by the jobs of bank tellers and bill collectors gave us the term emotional labor. This named a massive, required component of many jobs that lay in plain view but was systemically overlooked because it did not fit into the conventional narrative of what constitutes valuable work. Feynman’s anecdote is useful and succinct — its punchline says that just because something doesn’t look like work doesn’t mean it’s not. But Hochschild is bold enough to see that the hidden nature of work extends to the social conditions of the workers themselves. If, as Feynman would have it, hard work requires us to take an active interpretation of the nature of work itself, we must question the worker’s conditions as well. We cannot stop simply because our personal comfort or standing may be threatened. A strategy that works in most contexts save for some biased oversights doesn’t truly look at the whole problem. Anecdotes, principles, or axioms about work that ignore the implied role and status of the speaker — or of entire categories of people — should be as suspect as ones that ignore relevant, practical information.\n\nExpertise Requires More Than Conventional Narratives Can Offer\n\nThe unique value of the work done by experts comes from their ability to navigate, understand, and describe this kind of work1, let alone execute it.\n\nEveryone is an expert in something, even if it is only where to find things in their kitchen. At some point we have all struggled to explain, to ourselves or to others, why the job that non-experts think we are doing is completely different than the real, tricky thing we are trying to accomplish, even if it looks similar from the outside. We have no guarantee that the conceptual labor we have done to make our expert work possible will be visible to observers, and it is difficult to remember how a novice sees the task. Likewise, we have all been confronted by a complex task that, when prepared and executed by an expert, looks like child’s play.\n\nWe cannot understand expertise or innovation without conceptual labor. Painter James McNeil Whistler was highly influential on the development of modern painting, but his work was once ridiculed for its simplicity by critics who preferred classical technique. One such review led to a libel trial, where he famously defied the idea that the value of a painting was tied to the time spent painting it. When pressed if he asked market prices for “the labour of two days”, he responded: “No, I ask it for the knowledge I have gained in the work of a lifetime.”\n\nA much more recent anecdote from economist Dan Ariley about a locksmith who lost wages as he gained mastery shows that the difficulty of putting a price on wisdom isn’t just a problem for professional artists. When the locksmith was still a novice, he would struggle with locks for hours at a time, sometimes breaking them. His customers waited and watched the whole process, and tipped him well for all of his hard work, even if they had to replace their lock. Once he became an expert, however, he could open locks in a fraction of the time, with apparent ease and without damaging them. Not only did this cause his customers to tip him less, but they started complaining about his base fee, even though they were getting a more valuable service. This locksmith had encountered his profession’s version of a refrain that painters have been hearing since at least Whistler’s time: “Well I could do that.”\n\nConceiving of Work Is Work\n\nThe point here is that simply conceiving of work can be difficult. When we encounter work that lies beyond our imagination, we still judge it within the limits of our current understanding. Novices only see the work once it has been conceived, and without the domain knowledge, experience, and judgement of an expert, they fail to see how the work must be continuously re-conceived as it is performed.  They don’t appreciate the work it took to produce what’s in front of them at any given moment because, in part, they can’t see it without doing at least some of the work itself.2. Conceptual labor creates the very ground on which it is performed.\n\nThis is why it’s not hard find experts who advocate for a new way to consider their work, regardless of discipline, that focuses on the conceptual labor involved.\n\nA good starting point is any time someone uses the phrase “the art of,” such as Richard Hamming’s The Art Of Doing Science and Engineering. Lewis Thomas’s essay The Planning of Science addresses conceptual labor in the biomedical field, Zadie Smith calls writing the “craft that defies craftsmanship” in her excellent essay Fail Better, Bret Victor’s talk Media for Thinking the Unthinkable challenged coders and designers to deconstruct the media that encodes their ideas, Chris Argyris’s Teaching Smart People How To Learn brings it to the field of corporate management, and in math we have Paul Lockhart’s A Mathematician’s Lament. Rebecca Solnit’s profound and surprising tour around the territory of this way of thinking, A Field Guide to Getting Lost, digs into a challenge posed by Meno to Socrates: “How will you go about finding that thing the nature of which is totally unknown to you?”\n\nThis, surely, is hard work, but can we recognize it when we and others are doing it? To paraphrase Burton Rascoe, the spouses of writers will never understand that they are hard at work when staring out the window.\n\nThe Endless Argument\n\nWe have all been the writer, and we have all been the spouse, often both during the same project. As we produce and examine narratives of our own work, we are trying to see more than we can see.\n\nSeeing the narrative of work for what it is rather than what we imagine it to be is the true difference between expert and novice. According to the novice, experts work beyond the boundary of confusing work, where all the work makes sense to those that know enough about it. The expert, however, knows that they will continually lose sight of the work as it evolves, and they have the skills and attitudes that let them move back and forth across that boundary of understanding.\n\nWe will never fully appreciate the work we are trying to invent before we have invented it. The disagreement between an objecting, impatient novice and an expert trying to explain the transformative nature of their work plays out in our own heads as we do difficult, conceptual labor.\n\nConventional narratives of work and the strategies that go with them assume that this will be an argument, and emphasize determination, persistence, and knowledge. These are fine qualities in the abstract, but also how you break a lock. A general theory of conceptual labor should provide rules of order to this argument so that it can become a lively conversation, full of productive debate and surprises.\n\n&gt; The Theory\n\n  \n    \n      Feynman prided himself on being able to explain complex ideas simply, at one point declaring that, since he wasn’t able to describe an aspect of quantum mechanics to a freshman class, it was not fully understood by science. David L. Goodstein relates this anecdote in his introduction to a lecture by Feynman in which he used only high-school geometry to describe planetary motion. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Daniel Kahnamen’s research into how we frame our decisions based on available knowledge provides thorough support for this assertion. After establishing the influence of framing on problem solving strategies through years of studies, he and his contemporaries now refer to the phenomenon with the acronym WYSIATI — what you see is all there is. Citation Likewise, George Lakoff’s research addresses the effects of linguistic framing on the meaning of statements. There has been a resurgence in interest in his work since the 2016 US election, as it describes many of the mechanics behind propaganda and messaging used by politicians and the media.

  content: "We work according to a narrative. The conventional narrative defines legitimate work within a fixed progression from incomplete to complete. Conceptual labor is a distinct form of work that includes the efforts to continuously modify the narrative that defines legitimate work and how to do it.\n\nTo do conceptual labor, one must be able to conceive of and manipulate a dynamic mental model of work. These models can be described by three fundamental components: Actors, Labor, and Context. Humans experience all types of work through their models, whether or not those models accurately represent real world conditions.\n\nIn a given job, if the Actor, Labor, and Context are all able to change themselves and each other, conceptual labor is required and conventional labor will fail. Overwhelming anecdotal, experiential, and scientific evidence shows that humans default to a conventional narrative of work, where at least one element can be treated as reliable and fixed (eg the Labor may change as you go on, and the Actor’s state of mind may adapt, but the end goals and their means of achieving them — the Context — will be treated as if they are defined and known.) By definition, conceptual labor is a continuous process that occurs as long as the Actor’s model changes.\n\nIn this process, Actors represent and compare models and their components to align them with the changing requirements of their work. The decision to keep changing or to stick with what you know is a self-reflective process that must criticize and justify its own rules and progress. This generates meta-processes that apply generally to labor, conceptual or not. These processes often emerge by inferring broader principles from direct experience with specific kinds of work. In this way, conceptual labor proceeds from direct experience to abstraction and returns to direct experience, without regard to conventional definitions of work.\n\n",

  content: "Tenet 1\n\nWork can be modeled with fundamental components\n\n\n\nPreliminary Definitions\n\n\n  Work refers to the overall state of acting to produce results.\n  Job refers to a defined unit of work — the thing you are trying to do.\n  Labor refers to the effort one makes while working.\n\n\nModels\n\nIt is the nature of our attention that we subdivide large jobs into smaller jobs, so whatever conditions that guide our labor at any given stage of work define the job being done. A model is a dynamic theory of work that is meant to thoroughly represent the behaviors that occur within all jobs related to the work at hand.\n\nHowever complex these models are, their significant components can be categorized as one of following three fundamental components.\n\n1. Actors\n\nActors are anything performing work or work-equivalent actions. An individual at work is the typical actor within a job.1\n\n2. Labor\n\nLabor is any action taken by an actor that is intended to contribute to work, or that can be defined as work by its results2.\n\n3. Context\n\nContext is the total of all conditions that the actors believe to be relevant to the execution of labor as part of a job 3.\n\nIn this theory, then, work is when an actor labors within a context to complete a job, following their model to do so.\n\nTenet 2\n\nIndividuals experience work through a unique mental model\n\n\n\nGiven any description of a job, we cannot assume that everyone who does the work it demands will understand it in the terms and structure used by that description. Nor can we assume that the description is exhaustive for all circumstances. Even when work is thought to be “brainless” and routine, we review the conditions of a job and load them into our own mental model. Though this model may refer to external instructions or materials, our models are what we directly engage with.\n\n“What am I trying to do here?” is a classic statement to initiate a new model. We ask this question of ourselves and our circumstances, and then work according to the best answer we can get.\n\nTenet 3\n\nConceptual labor is required when all components of a model are dynamic\n\n\n\nThough work involves change by definition, it can still be systematized, described, and predicted in effective ways if at least one of its fundamental components can be treated as a known quantity. This is Type 1 work — the work we do when we think we know what to do. In this type of work, being confused about the job is not part of the job.\n\nHowever, work behaves much differently when all significant components are dynamic. When the Actor, Labor, and Context are all able to change on their own accord, and if changing the conditions of any one component will meaningfully change another, the work takes on another dimension. In this type of work, solving one’s confusion, coming up with new instructions, and executing them are all considered part of the same job.\n\nExample\n\nAny non-plumber who has fixed a discrete problem in their bathroom has an intuitive understanding of the difference between these modes of work. They may have solved a plumbing problem, but they’re not going to start work as a plumber the next day. That work would require them to walk into bathrooms they had never seen before, imagine the problem quickly and accurately, and draw on their theoretical understanding of plumbing to furnish an appropriate solution, repeating the whole process if their initial theory of the problem was incorrect. It would seem that “being a plumber” involves so much more than just “doing plumbing.”\n\nTenet 4\n\nWe tend towards models with static and well-defined components\n\n\n\nWhen our understanding of a mental model changes significantly, we have to engage mental tools like analytical thinking and self-examination. The concepts of System 1 and System 2 thinking which come from modern dual-process4 theory support this tenet. System 1 “operates automatically and quickly” 5, and we rely on System 2 to challenge assumptions and conduct systematic efforts. A robust body of research overwhelmingly shows that this is a taxing mental process which we only engage when absolutely necessary. System 1 is our default mode.\n\nTenet 5\n\nConceptual labor requires actors to continuously update their models\n\n\n\nConceptual labor is more than simply moving back and forth between the two poles of understood work (Type 1) and the analysis of work (Type 2). Dual-process theory is useful again here if we allow a rough equivalence between Type 1 work and System 1 thinking, and likewise with Type 2 and System 2. Conceptual labor is a dynamic pattern of thinking and behavior that integrates the automatic processes of System 1 thinking with the self-monitoring work of System 2, while also performing the meta-work required to switch between systems and update the assumptions that System 1 brings to the context. Even in disciplines that are highly attuned to the demands they make on System 2 thinking, crucial forms of meta-work such as judgement and time-management are often considered to be as separate from the “real work” as confusion is considered to be separate from Type 1 work. One could make a case for using “System 3” as shorthand for conceptual labor.\n\nTenet 6\n\nPart of conceptual labor is understanding and explaining why it is necessary\n\n\n\nThere is work involved in understanding why conventional labor won’t work or why a narrative of how one should be working is wrong. When the conditions of work meet Tenet 3, conventional labor is no longer effective, but it is the mode we will employ by default (Tenet 4). Therefor, attentiveness and sensitivity to the changing requirements of a job can be considered a skill in its own right.\n\nExample\n\nJohn Seeley Brown and Paul Duguid described this work as “non-canonical” work, falling outside the “canonical” work detailed in their job descriptions. Amy Wrzesniewski and Jane E. Dutton’s influential 2001 study, Crafting a Job: Revisioning Employees as Active Crafters of Their Work applies those concepts when profiling the ways that hospital cleaners “change the meaning of their jobs to be helpers of the sick” and “see the work of the floor unit as an integrated whole of which they are a vital part.” The study shows how this “job crafting” emerges from experience. Their ability to adapt to the changing Context of their job and the needs of the individual patients they encounter is a skill which cannot be adequately encoded in their canonical job descriptions. They recognize that, rather than blindly doing what they should do (clean), asking the question of why are they there is important (they improve the quality of life for patients). Job crafting reflects the conceptual labor of an engaged worker’s ongoing interrogation of their canonical work.\n\nTenet 7\n\nConceptual labor tends towards abstraction but is rooted in specifics\n\n\n\nWhen confronted with the shifting circumstances described by Tenet 3, an important, instinctual response is to look for patterns in the uncertainty. At the same time, Tenets 5 and 6 require awareness of the specific and contingent conditions of the work as it happens. Therefor, effective conceptual labor embodies general, portable concepts in the materials and language of a specific practice.\n\nExample\n\nThe infamous quip that “Writing about music is like dancing about architecture” paints a vivid picture to suggest that this is not true. The vivacity of dancers doing their work seems to underscore the futility of communicating between disciplines which have their own vocabulary. But it only works if we believe that dance has nothing to say outside of the world of dance. Otherwise, we have to accept the unlikely circumstance that architecture, specifically and wholly, is a topic dance may not speak about. A much more interesting and useful reading spurs one to imagine all the new things that could be said about music or architecture using different modes of knowing and communicating, dance included. Architects, dancers, writers, and musicians all absorb things from the outside world and attempt to encode them in their work. This tenet simply declares that decoding is possible and necessary.\n\n&gt; Summary\n\n\n  \n    \n      Other parties that appear to be relevant to the outcome of the job may also be considered actors. This includes automated equipment, materials and their properties, other humans, software, corporate policy, and even a set of instructions such as the rules of a game. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      This includes actions that are taken with little confidence in their effectiveness or relevance in relation to an expected outcome. Poorly-directed or exploratory labor is still labor. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      It is worth noting that erroneous assumptions about the conditions of a job are, by definition, treated as true until disproven. Likewise, unknown but important information cannot be part of the context until it is known. A captain sailing into an unknown storm is sailing as if the storm does not exist. As soon as they become aware of the possibility of a storm, the context of their job changes. If they believe a storm is on the way, they sail accordingly, even if the storm never arrives. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Dual Process Summary From Wikipedia: “The dual-process accounts of reasoning posits that there are two systems or minds in one brain. The theory of two distinct kinds of reasoning has been around for as long as documentations about theories of reasoning go. The current theory is that there are two distinctively separate cognitive systems underlying thinking and reasoning and that these different systems were developed through evolution . . . These systems are often referred to as “implicit” and “explicit” or by the more neutral “System 1” and “System 2,” as coined by Stanovich and West.” &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Kahneman states in Thinking, Fast and Slow: System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n  \n\n",
