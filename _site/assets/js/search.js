  content: "How We Talk About Work Is How We Work\n\nAll work follows a story. We work, consciously or not, according to a narrative that describes what we do, why we do it, and what it accomplishes. There are two different types of work in a basic narrative —  work that we think needs to be done, and the effort to figure out what to do.\n\nMost narratives focus on the first type, work which applies directly to a problem. Given a task that takes longer to understand than to accomplish, we will often lament how much time we wasted getting to the “real work.” However real or fraudulent work may feel, we define it by what we can understand of it.\n\nNobel physicist Richard Feynman was fond of telling a story from his youth in which a third, important type of work emerges from the whole process of picturing, doing, and understanding work. We will call this kind of work conceptual labor.\n\nAs an inquisitive child in the Great Depression, Feynman turned his early fascination with electronics into a side-hustle fixing radios. One day he was confronted with a radio that made a terrible noise he hadn’t heard before. He had to really think about what could be wrong, pacing back and forth while modeling the radio. Suddenly the owner of the radio shouted at him, complaining that he was just walking around, doing nothing. Young Feynman shot back “I’m thinking!” Once Feynman fixed the radio, the previously impatient owner became his biggest fan. He found Feynman many more jobs while bragging up his ability — “He fixes radios by thinking!”\n\n\n\nLooking at the Whole Problem is a Different Type of Work\n\nFeynman told this story not to talk about radios, but to talk about a way of working and thinking. The first section of his memoir, Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman, opens with the radio story and flows into examples of how the same kind of work applies to social situations, public education, and math, at one point connecting the FORTRAN language to how he repaired mechanical typewriters. In each case, Feynman’s infectious, joyful curiosity was sparked by “the whole problem of discovering what was the matter, and figuring out what you have to do to fix it.” He even invented his own system of mathematical notation because the conventional terms and symbols didn’t satisfy his needs. And why shouldn’t he? If doing math was a way for Feynman to engage the whole problem in front of him, the properties of math itself are fair game.\n\nBy asking us to look at the whole process of working on a complex problem, Feynman suggests a fundamentally different way of working that cannot be fully described by a back-and-forth between the two basic types of work — Type 1 being direct, understood work and Type 2 being the effort to understand that work. Rather than striving to find a clear narrative and stick to it, in this work one has to continuously create potential narratives of work while adapting to the circumstances in which the work occurs.\n\nThis conceptual labor integrates Type 1 and Type 2 work with a third dimension of skills and practices. These include the labor to define what work is, to learn how it must be done, and to invent new ways of working. These skills interact with technical knowledge, but extend beyond the limits of specialized training. After all, the radio owner was surprised by how fixing worked, not how the radio worked.\n\nHe followed the conventional narrative of labor, in which we judge work by available knowledge and prioritize Type 1 work. This narrative of work tells us that writing a novel is more like reporting than it is like driving a race car because of how these activities and their results look from the outside. Feynman didn’t see things this way, and he was freer for it.\n\nConventional narratives can serve us well, but they fail us all the time, often at great cost. At some point, everyone has done work which felt productive at the time only to discover that it had actually accomplished nothing. The feeling of productivity came from following the narrative, not meeting the actual requirements of the task. When this happens, it is easy to believe that we had the wrong instructions, and the right ones are out there somewhere. If we could just find them, we’d be able to follow them faithfully to the solution.\n\nIt is much harder to consider that some work has no straightforward story. Work that occurs in the absence of a narrative is confusing, demoralizing, and difficult. (Unless we are allowed to make it into play.) Regardless, some work can only be understood as one does it, some work continuously changes so it will never be fully described, and some work must be invented as it occurs. Such work frequently involves other people, learning something new, or understanding the behavior of a complex system. When we attempt to apply conventional narratives to this kind of work, we create new problems and fail at our original task.\n\nExpertise Requires More Than Conventional Narratives Can Offer\n\nThe unique value of the work done by experts like Feynman comes from their ability to navigate, understand, and describe this kind of work, let alone execute it1.\n\nEveryone is an expert in something, even if it is only where to find things in their kitchen. At some point we have all struggled to explain, to ourselves or to others, why the job that non-experts think we are doing is completely different than the real, tricky thing we are trying to accomplish, even if it looks similar from the outside. We have no guarantee that the conceptual labor we have done to make our expert work possible will be visible to observers, and it is difficult to remember how a novice sees the task. Likewise, we have all been confronted by a complex task that, when prepared and executed by an expert, looks like child’s play.\n\nWe cannot understand expertise or innovation without conceptual labor. Painter James McNeil Whistler was enormously influential on the development of modern painting, but his work was once ridiculed for its simplicity by critics who preferred classical technique. One such review led to a libel trial, where he famously defied the idea that the value of a painting was tied to the time spent painting it. When pressed if he asked market prices for “the labour of two days”, he responded: “No, I ask it for the knowledge I have gained in the work of a lifetime.”\n\nA much more recent anecdote from economist Dan Ariley about a locksmith who lost wages as he gained mastery shows that the difficulty of putting a price on wisdom isn’t just a problem for professional artists. When the locksmith was still a novice, he would struggle with locks for hours at a time, sometimes breaking them. His customers waited and watched the whole process, and tipped him well for all of his hard work, even if they had to replace their lock. Once he became an expert, however, he could open locks in a fraction of the time, with apparent ease and without damaging them. Not only did this cause his customers to tip him less, but they started complaining about his base fee, even though they were getting a more valuable service. This locksmith had encountered his profession’s version of a refrain that painters have been hearing since at least Whistler’s time: “Well I could do that.”\n\nConceiving of Work Is Work\n\nThe point here is that simply conceiving of work can be difficult. When we encounter work that lies beyond our imagination, we still judge it within the limits of our current understanding. Novices only see the work once it has been conceived, and without the domain knowledge, experience, and judgement of an expert, they fail to see how the work must be continuously re-conceived as it is performed.  They don’t appreciate the work it took to produce what’s in front of them at any given moment because, in part, they can’t see it without doing at least some of the work itself.2. Conceptual labor creates the very ground on which it is performed.\n\nThis is why it’s not hard find experts who advocate for a new way to consider their work, regardless of discipline, that focuses on the conceptual labor involved.\n\nA good starting point is any time someone uses the phrase “the art of,” such as Lionel Hamming’s The Art Of Doing Science and Engineering. Lewis Thomas’s essay The Planning of Science addresses conceptual labor in the biomedical field, Zadie Smith calls writing the “craft that defies craftsmanship” in her excellent essay Fail Better, Brett Victor’s talk Designing On Principle challenged coders and designers to think this way about the act of programming, Chris Argyris’s Teaching Smart People How To Learn brings it to the field of corporate management, and in math we have Paul Lockhart’s A Mathematician’s Lament. Rebecca Solnit’s profound and surprising tour around the territory of this way of thinking, A Field Guide to Getting Lost, digs into a challenge posed by Meno to Socrates: “How will you go about finding that thing the nature of which is totally unknown to you?”\n\nThis, surely, is hard work, but can we recognize it when we and others are doing it? To paraphrase Burton Rascoe, the spouses of writers will never understand that they are hard at work when staring out the window.\n\nThe Endless Argument\n\nWe have all been the writer, and we have all been the spouse, often both during the same project. As we produce and examine narratives of our own work, we are trying to see more than we can see.\n\nSeeing the narrative of work for what it is rather than what we imagine it to be is the true difference between expert and novice. According to the novice, experts work beyond the boundary of confusing work, where all the work makes sense to those that know enough about it. The expert, however, knows that they will continually lose sight of the work as it evolves, and they have the skills and attitudes that let them move back and forth across that boundary of understanding.\n\nWe will never fully appreciate the work we are trying to invent before we have invented it. The disagreement between an objecting, impatient novice and an expert trying to explain the transformative nature of their work plays out in our own heads as we do difficult, conceptual labor.\n\nConventional narratives of work and the strategies that go with them assume that this will be an argument, and emphasize determination, persistence, and knowledge. These are fine qualities in the abstract, but also how you break a lock. A general theory of conceptual labor should provide rules of order to this argument so that it can become a lively conversation, full of productive debate and surprises.\n\n&gt; The Theory\n\n  \n    \n      “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” is one of Feynman’s most popular quotes. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Daniel Kahnamen’s research into how we frame our decisions based on available knowledge provides thorough support for this assertion. After establishing the influence of framing on problem solving strategies through years of studies, he and his contemporaries now refer to the phenomenon with the acronym WYSIATI — what you see is all there is. Likewise, George Lakoff’s research addresses the effects of linguistic framing on the meaning of statements. There has been a resurgence in interest in his work since the 2016 US election, as it describes many of the mechanics behind propaganda and messaging used by politicians and the media. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n  \n\n",

  content: "This theory, alone, is little more than a framework, distilled from methods and patterns which are found in the practices and theory of countless other disciplines. It is not meant to define which activities are conceptual labor and which aren’t; that would be as useful and possible as documenting every change in the surface of a river. It is more to say that one can identify patterns of conditions, habits, and questions that tend to be useful in understanding and navigating almost any river.\n\nA shared language of conceptual labor can enhance the speed and quality with which such patterns can be understood and shared, in the work that we recognize as work as well as the important areas of our personal lives as citizens that we each labor daily to improve.\n\nTo go one step further, it suggests that though these patterns of work are not secret, but they are usually hidden in the fabric of the conventional stories we tell about work. By naming and studying these patterns, we should be able to spot them more readily, rather than falling back on comfortable narratives of how work should go.\n\nSome patterns are simple to translate between disciplines. “Put your tools away when you are done” can be easily applied by someone who doesn’t work with physical tools. But ask any expert who loves their field, and they will tell you how their profession has taught them something about the rest of life that they never knew before. Some might even be ready with a pitch for why everyone should study what they study. We can’t assume that they’ve all discovered the same things, or in the same proportions. It is a compelling thought to imagine that their enthusiasm is justified, and that countless secret methods, useful to anyone who does hard work, lie hidden behind the labels we use to organize professions and subjects.\n\nIt is my hope that with a framework such as this theory, the lessons we learn from the hard work we do in one discipline can be more readily translated and applied to another. The more familiar we are with common patterns of conceptual labor, the more quickly we can recognize them when they show up in new circumstances, dressed up in the appearance of a novel task. We have yet to appreciate the extent to which valuable practices and knowledge can be transferred from the ontologies of one field to another.\n",

  content: "Tenet 1\nWork can be modeled with fundamental components\n\n\n\nPreliminary Definitions\n\n\n  Work refers to the overall state of acting to produce results.\n  Job refers to a defined unit of work — the thing you are trying to do.\n  Labor refers to the effort one makes while working.\n\n\nModels\n\nIt is the nature of our attention that we subdivide large jobs into smaller jobs, so whatever conditions that guide our labor at any given stage of work define the job being done. A model is a dynamic theory of work that is meant to thoroughly represent the behaviors that occur within all jobs related to the work at hand.\n\nHowever complex these models are, their significant components can be categorized as one of following three fundamental components.\n\n1. Actors\n\nActors are anything performing work or work-equivalent actions. An individual at work is the typical actor within a job.1\n\n2. Labor\n\nLabor is any action taken by an actor that is intended to contribute to work, or that can be defined as work by its results2.\n\n3. Context\n\nContext is the total of all conditions that the actors believe to be relevant to the execution of labor as part of a job 3.\n\nIn this theory, then, work is when an actor labors within a context to complete a job, following their model to do so.\n\nTenet 2\nIndividuals experience work through a unique mental model\n\n\n\nGiven any description of a job, we cannot assume that everyone who does the work it demands will understand it in the terms and structure used by that description. Nor can we assume that the description is exhaustive for all circumstances. Even when work is thought to be “brainless” and routine, we review the conditions of a job and load them into our own mental model. Though this model may refer to external instructions or materials, our models are what we directly engage with.\n\n“What am I trying to do here?” is a classic statement to initiate a new model. We ask this question of ourselves and our circumstances, and then work according to the best answer we can get.\n\nTenet 3\nConceptual labor is required when all components of a model are dynamic\n\n\n\nThough work involves change by definition, it can still be systematized, described, and predicted in effective ways if at least one of its fundamental components can be treated as a known quantity. This is Type 1 work — the work we do when we think we know what to do. In this type of work, being confused about the job is not part of the job.\n\nHowever, work behaves much differently when all significant components are dynamic. When the Actor, Labor, and Context are all able to change on their own accord, and if changing the conditions of any one component will meaningfully change another, the work takes on another dimension. In this type of work, solving one’s confusion, coming up with new instructions, and executing them are all considered part of the same job.\n\nExample\n\nAny non-plumber who has fixed a discrete problem in their bathroom has an intuitive understanding of the difference between these modes of work. They may have solved a plumbing problem, but they’re not going to start work as a plumber the next day. That work would require them to walk into bathrooms they had never seen before, imagine the problem quickly and accurately, and draw on their theoretical understanding of plumbing to furnish an appropriate solution, repeating the whole process if their initial theory of the problem was incorrect. It would seem that “being a plumber” involves so much more than just “doing plumbing.”\n\nTenet 4\nWe tend towards models with static and well-defined components\n\n\n\nWhen our understanding of a mental model changes significantly, we have to engage mental tools like analytical thinking and self-examination. The concepts of System 1 and System 2 thinking which come from modern dual-process theory support this tenet. System 1 “operates automatically and quickly” 4, and we rely on System 2 to challenge assumptions and conduct systematic efforts. A robust body of research overwhelmingly shows that this is a taxing mental process which we only engage when absolutely necessary. System 1 is our default mode.\n\nTenet 5\nConceptual labor requires actors to continuously update their models\n\n\n\nConceptual labor is more than simply moving back and forth between the two poles of understood work (Type 1) and the analysis of work (Type 2). Dual-process theory is useful again here if we allow a rough equivalence between Type 1 work and System 1 thinking, and likewise with Type 2 and System 2. Conceptual labor is a dynamic pattern of thinking and behavior that integrates the automatic processes of System 1 thinking with the self-monitoring work of System 2, while also performing the meta-work required to switch between systems and update the assumptions that System 1 brings to the context. Even in disciplines that are highly attuned to the demands they make on System 2 thinking, crucial forms of meta-work such as judgement and time-management are often considered to be as separate from the “real work” as confusion is considered to be separate from Type 1 work. One could make a case for using “System 3” as shorthand for conceptual labor.\n\nTenet 6\nPart of conceptual labor is understanding and explaining why it is necessary\n\n\n\nThere is work involved in understanding why conventional labor won’t work or why a narrative of how one should be working is wrong. When the conditions of work meet Tenet 4, conventional labor is no longer effective, but it is the mode we will employ by default (Tenet 3). Therefor, attentiveness and sensitivity to the changing requirements of a job can be considered a skill in its own right.\n\nExample\n\nThe radio owner’s change of opinion about young Feynman illustrates the crucial role of this skill — he interrupted a necessary part of the process because it didn’t match his unexamined model of “fixing a radio,” and only updated his model after he saw proof that it was incomplete.\n\nTenet 7\nConceptual labor tends towards abstraction but is rooted in specifics\n\n\n\nWhen confronted with the shifting circumstances described by Tenet 4, an important, instinctual response is to look for patterns in the uncertainty. At the same time, Tenets 5 and 6 require awareness of the specific and contingent conditions of the work as it happens. Therefor, effective conceptual labor embodies general, portable concepts in the materials and language of a specific practice.\n\nExample\n\nThe infamous quip that “Writing about music is like dancing about architecture” paints a vivid picture to suggest that this is not true. The vivacity of dancers doing their work seems to underscore the futility of communicating between disciplines which have their own vocabulary. But it only works if we believe that dance has nothing to say outside of the world of dance. Otherwise, we have to accept the unlikely circumstance that architecture, specifically and wholly, is a topic dance may not speak about. A much more interesting and useful reading spurs one to imagine all the new things that could be said about music or architecture using different modes of knowing and communicating, dance included. Architects, dancers, writers, and musicians all absorb things from the outside world and attempt to encode them in their work. This tenet simply declares that decoding is possible and necessary.\n\n&gt; Summary\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Other parties that appear to be relevant to the outcome of the job may also be considered actors. This includes automated equipment, materials and their properties, other humans, software, corporate policy, and even a set of instructions such as the rules of a game. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      This includes actions that are taken with little confidence in their effectiveness or relevance in relation to an expected outcome. Poorly-directed or exploratory labor is still labor. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      It is worth noting that erroneous assumptions about the conditions of a job are, by definition, treated as true until disproven. Likewise, unknown but important information cannot be part of the context until it is known. A captain sailing into an unknown storm is sailing as if the storm does not exist. As soon as they become aware of the possibility of a storm, the context of their job changes. If they believe a storm is on the way, they sail accordingly, even if the storm never arrives. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Dual Process Summary From Wikipedia: “The dual-process accounts of reasoning posits that there are two systems or minds in one brain. The theory of two distinct kinds of reasoning has been around for as long as documentations about theories of reasoning go. The current theory is that there are two distinctively separate cognitive systems underlying thinking and reasoning and that these different systems were developed through evolution….These systems are often referred to as “implicit” and “explicit” or by the more neutral “System 1” and “System 2,” as coined by Stanovich and West” Kahneman states in TODO: * System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. * System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n  \n\n",
