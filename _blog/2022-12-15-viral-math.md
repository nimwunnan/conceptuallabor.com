Presenting the first Conceptual Labor video! Will there be more? Who knows!

It's a response to a conversation between two YouTube titans, [Hank Green](https://www.youtube.com/@vlogbrothers){:target="blank"} and [Vi Hart](https://www.youtube.com/@Vihart){:target="blank"}. It started because Hank Green recognized a deeper pattern of online-disagreement in the (fairly pointless) arguments that were flying around over a "math problem" that goes viral on a fairly regular basis.

Here's Hank's take.

If you're already familiar with the Theory, you'll probably spot the parallels. He says some stuff about [expertise](https://youtu.be/lBJVyCYuu78?t=175) that parallels [what the Theory says](https://www.conceptuallabor.com/why-we-need-a-theory#expertise-grows-out-of-conceptual-labor). And the whole video generally explores the foundational ideas of [Tenets 1 and 2](https://www.conceptuallabor.com/expanded-theory#tenets-1--2-modeling-labor). I saw this right after it came out and thought, yes, I should make a video that *enthusiastically supports* Hank's claim that thinking about this will change your view of humanity.

Then Vi Hart, one of my favorite explainer-of-things of all time, made a *much more thorough* response video. And for much of it, Vi was doing a really engaging version of [Conceptual Labor Analysis](https://www.conceptuallabor.com/how-to-use-the-theory) on the "math" problem. It's great. You should watch it:

Video is very much *not* my natural medium, but this was too much to resist. I sprung into action and... took a month to make a response video. I hope they both still remember this whole conversation. In any case, here it is. I hope you enjoy:
