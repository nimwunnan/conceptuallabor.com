title: "Composition is Done"
---

I finished primary composition on the complete *Theory of Conceptual Labor* on Friday, July 10. That's my fancy way of saying that I'm done putting ideas into it, but it still needs much editing and arranging, which is a different kind of conceptual labor. It stands at roughly 36,000 words, includes core concepts grouped by Tenet, case studies and an expanded introduction. Check back here or get in touch for updates. I hope to release it by early 2021.
