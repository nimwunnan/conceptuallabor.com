[^fn67]: Particularly relevant to this point is the concept of “abduction” as described by Johnson-Laird in the paper “Mental Models and Human Reasoning”: “Human reasoners have an inductive skill that far surpasses any known algorithm...it is the ability to formulate explanations. Unlike valid deductions, inductions increase information, because they use knowledge to go beyond the strict content of the premises... even if the premises are true, no guarantee exists that an inductive conclusion is true, precisely because it goes beyond the information in the premesis. This principle applies *a fortiori* to those inductions that yield putative explanations --- a process often referred to as *abduction*.

[^fn69]: In our example, the friend who made the map didn’t intend to decieve. They, reasonably enough, worked on the map within a context where their knowledge of the trails in the park was up to date.

[^fn70]: A longitudinal read on various Model Theory research projects into human reasoning suppports this tenet. The overall question of why, in so many circumstances, do rational people draw incorrect conclusions when given correct information is repeatedly answered by detailing a mental model which produces such conclusions according to its internal logic, or as inferences from disparate qualities that can be held to be independently true in a model without resolving their potential contradictions.  See Johnson-Laird 1 p193-5, also Evans, New Stead and Byrne, 1993

[^fn71]: The discussion of the medium of conceptual labor in Tenet 7 in the Expanded Theory complements this assertion.

[^fn72]: These three fields intersect in the accessible Vitz, Paul C. “Analog Art and Digital Art: A Brain-Hemisphere Critique of Modern Painting.” In *The Foundations of Aesthetics, Art & Art Education*, edited by Frank H. Farley and Ronald W. Neperud, 43--86. New York: Praeger, 1988.

[^fn73]: This is supported by Conclusion 3 in Johnson-Laird, *How We Reason*, 203: “Mental models represent wht is true, but not what is false. Reasoners can --- with some difficulty --- flesh them out into fully explicit models.”

[^fn78]: It follows, then, that any theory that seeks to include the aspects of work that are left out by the Conventional Narrative would necessarily have to focus on the conditions of an individual’s experience of work.

[^fn80]: Dual Process Summary From Wikipedia: “The dual-process accounts of reasoning posits that there are two systems or minds in one brain. The theory of two distinct kinds of reasoning has been around for as long as documentations about theories of reasoning go. The current theory is that there are two distinctively separate cognitive systems underlying thinking and reasoning and that these different systems were developed through evolution . . . These systems are often referred to as “implicit” and “explicit” or by the more neutral “System 1” and “System 2,” as coined by Stanovich and West.” “Dual Process Theory.” In *Wikipedia*, May 13, 2021. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dual\_process\_theory&oldid=1022978665.

[^fn119]: In 2013, for example, a Boeing engineer suggested installing a computer-based airspeed indicator to supplement the 737 max’s single external speed sensor. The engineer’s request “was rejected by Boeing management due to cost concerns and because adding synthetic airspeed could have jeopardized the 737 MAX program’s directive to avoid pilot simulator training requirements,” the report says. If Boeing had told airlines that their pilots would need extensive retraining to fly the new planes, including instruction on how to react to an activation of the MCAS, the airlines might have been less eager to order them. Not only did Boeing neglect to inform the airlines about the MCAS, but it removed any references to it from the operations manual that pilots of the 737 max relied on. from Cassidy, John. “How Boeing and the F.A.A.

[^fn124]: Medium isn’t included as a fundamental component because it always sits outside of our models. A model is created from an actor’s perspective, so they always encounter their medium through their context.

[^fn125]: For example, the difference between one’s past ideas and current state of mind is important enough to the labor of computer programmers that they have a term for the problem. Eagleson’s Law states that “code you write six months ago might as well have been written by someone else.”

[^fn127]: The hypothetical mistake in the  chapter on Conceptual Labor Analysis can illustrate this. We don’t expect maps to be a photographic record of the outside world, we expect them to be a representation of information that is isomorphic to certain qualities of the outside world. Within those parameters, the map appeared, very reasonably, to be correct.

[^fn128]: The field of “embodied cognition” researches connections between  thought and physical experience, arguing that much of cognition is shaped by the whole organism. George Lakoff and his collaborators’ work on conceptual metaphor and prototypes are particularly relevant to anyone interested in conceptual labor.
