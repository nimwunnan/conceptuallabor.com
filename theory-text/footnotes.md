Defined as “any kind of creative work, either partial or completed, submitted by designers to prospective clients before designers secure both their work and equitable fees,” it is antagonistic enough to the actual labor of architects that many banded together to form a group dedicated to ending the practice. Called No!Spec, they fight for the recognition of the conceptual labor that goes into spec work. See  https://www.nospec.com

[^fn26]: Mathematician Kurt Gödel’s 1931 paper, "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems," used the formal logic of the Principia Mathematica, thought to be watertight in its ability to express provable statements, to prove that it was incomplete in two ways. “Gödel’s two incompleteness theorems ... concern the limits of provability in formal axiomatic theories. The first incompleteness theorem states that in any consistent formal system *F* within which a certain amount of arithmetic can be carried out, there are statements of the language of *F* which can neither be proved nor disproved in *F*. According to the second incompleteness theorem, such a formal system cannot prove that the system itself is consistent (assuming it is indeed consistent).” From Raatikainen, Panu. “Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems.” In *The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*, edited by Edward N.

[^fn42]: We see this when linguistic code-switching divides along racial lines; some groups can speak “normally” without a second thought, while others must modulate their usual way of speaking to suit a social context that won’t accommodate them without judgement or cost. They must do conceptual labor to model an accepted, unseen narrative so they may understand and adapt to its terms.

[^fn51]: Here is an example of a professional application of CLA. User experience designers could model computer users’ labor that, superficially, appear to be an end-user interacting with a finished product.

[^fn64]: Particularly relevant to this point is the concept of “abduction” as described by Johnson-Laird in the paper “Mental Models and Human Reasoning”: “Human reasoners have an inductive skill that far surpasses any known algorithm...it is the ability to formulate explanations. Unlike valid deductions, inductions increase information, because they use knowledge to go beyond the strict content of the premises... even if the premises are true, no guarantee exists that an inductive conclusion is true, precisely because it goes beyond the information in the premesis. This principle applies *a fortiori* to those inductions that yield putative explanations --- a process often referred to as *abduction*.

[^fn67]: A longitudinal read on various Model Theory research projects into human reasoning suppports this tenet. The overall question of why, in so many circumstances, do rational people draw incorrect conclusions when given correct information is repeatedly answered by detailing a mental model which produces such conclusions according to its internal logic, or as inferences from disparate qualities that can be held to be independently true in a model without resolving their potential contradictions.

[^fn114]: In 2013, for example, a Boeing engineer suggested installing a computer-based airspeed indicator to supplement the 737 max’s single external speed sensor. The engineer’s request “was rejected by Boeing management due to cost concerns and because adding synthetic airspeed could have jeopardized the 737 MAX program’s directive to avoid pilot simulator training requirements,” the report says. If Boeing had told airlines that their pilots would need extensive retraining to fly the new planes, including instruction on how to react to an activation of the MCAS, the airlines might have been less eager to order them. Not only did Boeing neglect to inform the airlines about the MCAS, but it removed any references to it from the operations manual that pilots of the 737 max relied on. from Cassidy, John. “How Boeing and the F.A.A.

[^fn119]: Medium isn’t included as a fundamental component because it always sits outside of our models. A model is created from an actor’s perspective, so they always encounter their medium through their context.

[^fn120]: For example, the difference between one’s past ideas and current state of mind is important enough to the labor of computer programmers that they have a term for the problem. Eagleson’s Law states that “code you write six months ago might as well have been written by someone else.”

[^fn122]: The hypothetical mistake in the  chapter on Conceptual Labor Analysis can illustrate this. We don’t expect maps to be a photographic record of the outside world, we expect them to be a representation of information that is isomorphic to certain qualities of the outside world. Within those parameters, the map appeared, very reasonably, to be correct.

[^fn123]: The field of “embodied cognition” researches connections between  thought and physical experience, arguing that much of cognition is shaped by the whole organism. George Lakoff and his collaborators’ work on conceptual metaphor and prototypes are particularly relevant to anyone interested in conceptual labor.
